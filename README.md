I'm a web developer that loves tooling and building UIs. I'm also a crazy music nerd.
Here are some things I'm working latelly:

### Start (template repo) - [Repository](https://github.com/davi-mbatista/start/):

Well, "Start" is a template repo that aims to simplify starting new projects based on the "Webpack + framework" formula. It covers
some of the basics of development and production building with an easy-to-follow and easy-to-change project structure. At the moment
it supports Vanilla JS, React, Preact, Svelte, and Lit-html. (They all live separated branches in the same repo). [Here is a talk that
I gave in Berlin about webpack](https://github.com/davi-mbatista/davi-mbatista/raw/master/misc/webpack-wants-to-be-your-friend.pdf). 


### Polytimer: [Live](https://polytimer.rocks) - [Repository](https://github.com/davi-mbatista/polytimer):

A dead simple timer PWA built with Polymer (v1). This app has some solid 1k users per-month.
(It needs some refactoring but, it is still usable)
