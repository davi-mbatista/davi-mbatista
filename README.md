### Hey hi, I'm Daví 👋

I'm a web developer that loves tooling and building UIs. I'm also a crazy music nerd.
Here are some things I'm working latelly:


#### ⏰ [Polytimer](https://polytimer.rocks):
A dead simple timer PWA built with Polymer (v1). This app has some solid 1k users per-month.
(It needs some refactoring but, it is still usable)
